The program implements a simple password manager application using the Tkinter library in Python. It allows users to generate 
strong passwords, store website login credentials, and retrieve them when needed. The user interface includes input fields for the 
website, email/username, and password, along with buttons for generating passwords, adding entries, and retrieving saved 
credentials. The application stores the data in a CSV file and provides basic error handling for missing or incorrect data. The user 
is prompted for a password to access the password manager, providing an additional layer of security.
